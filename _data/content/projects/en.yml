        # Congreso AJEF App

        Developed for the XXXIV AJEF National Congress in Chiapas, Mexico (2017), this Android app was used to manage over 300 event participants.

        ### ðŸ”‘ Features
        - Firebase Authentication (Google, Facebook, email)
        - QR-based access validation
        - Realtime database to update user info
        - Admin roles for staff
        - User activity selection

        ### ðŸ§ª Tech stack
        - Android Studio (Java)
        - Firebase Realtime Database
        - Firebase Auth
        - Google Forms for pre-registration

        [ðŸ§  GitHub Repository](https://github.com/manuelnajera/congreso-ajef-app)

        Although the app is no longer available on the Play Store (my account was removed due to inactivity), it still appears on third-party sites like <a href="https://apkcombo.com/congreso-ajef-2017/com.meb1.manuel.congresoajef/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">APKCombo</a>. While <strong>it's not a trusted source for downloading APKs</strong> â€” since files may be modified â€” it serves as a visual reminder that the app was once officially published.

        Screenshot from APKCombo showing my app as it was listed in 2017. Although no longer available officially, this serves as proof it was once live on the Play Store.
