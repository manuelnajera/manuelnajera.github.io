        [ðŸ§  GitHub Repository](https://github.com/manuelnajera/congreso-ajef-app)

        Although the app is no longer available on the Play Store (my account was removed due to inactivity), it still appears on third-party sites like <a href="https://apkcombo.com/congreso-ajef-2017/com.meb1.manuel.congresoajef/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">APKCombo</a>. While <strong>it's not a trusted source for downloading APKs</strong> â€” since files may be modified â€” it serves as a visual reminder that the app was once officially published.
