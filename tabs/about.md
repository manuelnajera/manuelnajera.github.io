## About Me

I'm Manuel NÃ¡jera â€” a civil engineer turned self-taught technologist with a passion for cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and automation.

With over 3 years of experience in infrastructure development, project coordination, and site engineering, I learned to approach problems with precision, structure, and resilience. Today, I apply that same mindset to the fields of digital defense and intelligent systems.

Iâ€™m currently:
- Exploring **ethical hacking** while finishing my **Cisco Ethical Hacking Certificate**
- Researching tools like **Goose**, **CUA**, **Skyvern**, and **Reaper**
- Learning how to build **AI agents** and **secure automation pipelines**
- Designing tools that blend **AI, cybersecurity, and real-world engineering needs**

### ðŸ§ª Early Development Projects

Before shifting into cybersecurity and AI, I explored mobile development and practical software-hardware integration:

- In 2016, I built an Android app for a national youth conference (AJEF) to manage registration, attendance, activity sign-ups, and QR-based validation using Firebase. Staff could scan participants and access live data through an admin panel with logs.
- In 2017, I developed a food ordering app for a local restaurant. It was fully functional but never scaled due to limited staff and the business eventually closing.
- My thesis involved implementing a laser deformimeter using Arduino and ToF sensors, with LabVIEW data acquisition and OCR-based stress reading from a mobile camera feed. I also designed and 3D-printed a protective enclosure for the electronics.

These projects laid the foundation for how I now approach building smart, secure, and purposeful systems.
