## Exploring the Future

I‚Äôm Manuel N√°jera ‚Äî cybersecurity and AI enthusiast exploring the intersection between intelligent automation and digital defense.

I'm currently researching and experimenting with tools, agents, and protocols like:
- üß† **LLM-based AI agents** (Goose, UI-TARS-desktop)
- üß© **Automation frameworks** like **n8n**, **Google A2A**, and **MCP**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Ethical hacking practices**, while completing my **Cisco Ethical Hacking Certificate**

My goal? To build autonomous systems that are secure by design.
